🚀 How to Use
Clone/download the project.
Open index.html in any browser.
Use the buttons to:
Scramble the cube randomly.
Manually rotate cube faces.
Solve using BFS + fallback strategies.
Reset to solved state.
💡 Technologies Used
JavaScript (ES6+)
SVG for cube visualization
DOM manipulation for UI and interaction
OOP patterns to manage cube logic
⚙️ Core Logic
RubiksCube manages cube state, move logic, face rotations, and scramble.
CubeSolver runs solving logic using beginner's method patterns and reverse scramble fallback.
SVG Renderer visualizes the cube in 2D layout with correct colors and face positions.
📚 Fun to Extend Ideas
Add keyboard controls (F, R, etc.)
Integrate timer for speed-solving practice
Implement 3D rendering with WebGL or Three.js
Add sound effects or solve-time leaderboard
